            <h2>Winter</h2>
            <h3>Plants can be planted in the winter, depending on your location and climate. Here are some examples of plants that can be planted during the winter: Winter vegetables, Ornamental plants, Trees and shrubs, Bulbs, and Winter annuals.</h3>
          </hgroup>
          <p>Some vegetables can thrive in colder temperatures, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and spinach. These can be planted in the late summer or early fall to mature during the winter.</p>
            <p>Some ornamental plants like winter jasmine, holly, and winterberry can be planted in the winter months for a pop of color and texture during the colder months.</p>
            <p>Deciduous trees and shrubs can be planted in the winter while they are dormant. This allows them to establish their root systems before spring.</p>
            <p>Certain bulbs like daffodils, tulips, and crocuses can be planted in the fall and will bloom during the winter and spring months.</p>
            <p>Plants like pansies, violas, and snapdragons can thrive in colder weather and add color to winter gardens.</p>

                  <h2>Autumn</h2>
                  <h3>Fall is a great time to plant a variety of plants. Here are some examples of plants that can be planted in the fall: Bulbs, Perennials, Trees and shrubs, Cool-season vegetables, and Ornamental grasses.</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <p>Fall is the perfect time to plant spring-blooming bulbs like tulips, daffodils, and crocuses.</p>
                <p>Fall is a great time to plant perennials like asters, mums, and sedum. Planting in the fall allows the roots to become established before winter and ensures they will bloom the following year.</p>
                <p>Fall is an ideal time to plant trees and shrubs while the soil is still warm and the weather is mild. This allows the roots to become established before winter.</p>
                <p>Vegetables that thrive in cooler temperatures, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, lettuce, and spinach, can be planted in the fall for a fall harvest.</p>
                <p>Fall is an excellent time to plant ornamental grasses like fountain grass, maiden grass, and switchgrass for year-round interest.</p>
